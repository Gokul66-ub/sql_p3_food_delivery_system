## üß± Database Schema (ER Diagram)

The system is built on a **normalized relational database model** designed to ensure data integrity and query efficiency.  
It comprises **five core tables** that interact to capture the entire order lifecycle.

## 12.  Customer Segmentation by Total Spending

Segment customers into **'Gold'** or **'Silver'** groups based on their **total spending** compared to the **average total spending** of all customers.

- If a customer's total spending **exceeds** the average total spending per customer, label them as **'Gold'**.  
- Otherwise, label them as **'Silver'**.

Write a **SQL query** to determine, for each segment, the following:

1. **Total number of orders**  
2. **Total revenue (spending)**


```sql
