# üçï Food Delivery System ‚Äî SQL Data Analytics Project

## üîπ Introduction

The **Food Delivery System** is an end-to-end **SQL-based data analytics project** that simulates a real-world online food delivery platform.  
It demonstrates a comprehensive approach to **database design**, **data generation**, and **complex SQL analysis** to uncover actionable business insights regarding customer behavior, restaurant performance, and delivery logistics.

## üß± Database Schema (ER Diagram)

The system is built on a **normalized relational database model** designed to ensure data integrity and query efficiency.  
It comprises **five core tables** that interact to capture the entire order lifecycle.

### Data Analysis and Finding

**1.Write a query to find top 5 most frequently ordered dish by Priya Sharma over last 1 year**
```sql

WITH top5_dish as (
    SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_item,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS freq_rank
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_name = 'Gagan Gupta'
  AND o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY c.customer_name, o.order_item
                      )
SELECT order_item
FROM top5_dish
WHERE freq_rank<=5
```
**2.Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed based on 2hour intervals**
```sql

SELECT
    FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 as start_time,
    FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 +2 as end_time,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY order_count DESC
```
**3.Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 18 orders and then return customer_name and avg order value**
```sql
SELECT 
    o.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    ROUND(AVG(total_amount),2) as average_order_value
FROM orders o

GROUP BY o.customer_id,c.customer_name
HAVING count(*)>18
ORDER BY average_order_value DESC
```
**4.List the customers who have spent more than 30K in total on food orders and then return customer_name and id**

```
**12. Customer Segmentation by Total SpendingSegment customers into 'Gold' or 'Silver' groups based on their total spending compared to the average total spending of all customers.
If a customer's total spending exceeds the average total spending per customer, label them as 'Gold'.Otherwise, label them as 'Silver'.
Write a SQL query to determine, for each segment, the following:Total number of orders Total revenue (spending)**

```sql
WITH customer_amount AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        SUM(total_amount) AS amount_spend,
        COUNT(*) AS total_orders

avg_customer_spend AS (
    SELECT AVG(amount_spend) AS avg_spend
    FROM customer_amount
),
customer_segment AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        amount_spend,
        total_orders,
        CASE
            WHEN amount_spend > (SELECT avg_spend FROM avg_customer_spend) THEN 'Gold'
            ELSE 'Silver'
        END AS customer_category
    FROM customer_amount
)
SELECT
    customer_category,
    SUM(total_orders) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(SUM(amount_spend),2) AS total_spend
FROM customer_segment
GROUP BY customer_category;
```
